# Refactor

Some of the page widgets (ChatPage, RegisterPage & RoomsPage) are quite long and
and the build method got a lot of nesting.

Use "Extract method" and "Extract Flutter Widget" to make code easier to read.

# Presence

Show which users are online using the
[Presence feature](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/presence?language=dart)
of Supabase.
