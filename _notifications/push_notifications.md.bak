Here we will expand the [local notifications demo](local-notifications) app with support for push notifications.

We are going to use an extension to Awesome Notifications to add push
notification support backed by FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging).

[Awesome Notifications FCM](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications_fcm)

<div class="alert warning">
Commercial use of "Awesome Notifications FCM" requires a license key.

You will need a Apple developer account to make it work on iPhone, which is a
yearly fee of 99 USD.
So let's just ignore iOS and focus on Android.

# Firebase Cloud Messaging

Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.

Place `google-services.json` in `android/app/src`.
Add `android/app/google-services.json` to `.gitignore`.


# FireFlutter

To connect a Flutter project to Firebase (required to use FCM), you need a CLI
tool called [FlutterFire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview/).

```sh
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

When it is installed you need to configure your Flutter project for the Firebase
project you created earlier.

```sh
flutterfire configure
```

The command will give you a menu.
Use arrow keys to navigate and "Enter/Return" to select.
Here is a walkthrough of the options you need.

1. Select "awesome-notifications"
2. Make sure "android" is selected

# Installing plugin extension

We need to add some dependencies:

```sh
flutter pub add awesome_notifications_fcm:any firebase_core firebase_analytics
```

Then update `android/settings.gradle`:
